 # Basic-IOT-project

1. First project is switching the led light on and off for every 1sec(1000ms)
  system is connected to an led bulb and with this program it is on and off for every one second
     
     
     
2. Other project is switching on the bulb without any physical switch 
  we connected an digital switch and the bulb is switched on/off without the use of any physical switch

'''And all the code to perform the above 2projects is stored in the microcontroller that is attached to the laptop with the help of a wire 
 and the LED bulb and pins are attached to microcontroller according to the project requirements.'''
